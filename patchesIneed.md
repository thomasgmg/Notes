# Patches everybody needs when using DWM:
- alpha
- appicons
- awesomebar
- barpadding
- centeredwindowname
- clientmonoclesymbol (not really sure what this does yet...)
- dualstatus / extrabar
- exitmenu
- fancybar
- fullgaps
- hide vacant tags
- keybindings / keychain / Keychord
- keymodes
- launcher + launcher-colors (I will probably not use this, as it uses the mouse)
- layoutmenu (Xmenu needs to be installed)
- layoutscroll
- movecenter
- moveresize
- pertag
- Rotate stack
- schemeSwitch
- scratchpads
- setborderpx (allows you to change border pixels at runtime)
- setxkbgroup (allows idempotent keyboard layout switching from dwm)
- SGR in status text (fun, but a bit bloated, so I will probably not use this)
- showselmon
- splitstatus (may be insteresting)
- stacker
- statuscmd
- steam (if you have issues with steam)
- sticky + stickyindicator (I would although use this symbol in stickyindicator:  or  )
- switchtotag
- tatami layout
- Three Column Layout
- truecenteredtitle
- vanitygaps
- winicon
