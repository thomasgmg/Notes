# Patches everybody needs when using DWM:
- [x] barpadding
- [x] cyclelayouts
- exitmenu + restartsig (needed)
- [x] hide vacant tags
- keybindings / keychain / Keychord
- keymodes
- [x] layoutmenu (Xmenu needs to be installed ->  )
- [x] movecenter
- [x] moveresize
- [x] pertag
- Rotate stack
- [x] scratchpads
- setxkbgroup (allows idempotent keyboard layout switching from dwm)
- statuscmd
- [x] sticky + stickyindicator (I would although use this symbol in stickyindicator:  or  )
- [x] vanitygaps
- [x] winicon
